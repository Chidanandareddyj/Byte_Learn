  "narration": "Welcome to our exploration of the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is a powerful tool used to solve quadratic equations of the form ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero. The formula itself is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, all divided by 2a. Let's work through a concrete example to see how this works. Consider the equation x squared minus 5x plus 6 equals zero. In this case, a equals 1, b equals negative 5, and c equals 6. Substituting these values into our formula, we get x equals 5 plus or minus the square root of 25 minus 24, all divided by 2. The discriminant, 25 minus 24, equals 1, so we have x equals 5 plus or minus 1, divided by 2. This gives us two solutions: x equals 3 and x equals 2. These are the x-intercepts of the parabola represented by our quadratic equation."
