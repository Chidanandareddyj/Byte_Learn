## 🥇 **Option 1: Railway (Recommended)**

### Why Railway is Perfect:
- ✅ **Docker-native**: Your Dockerfile works out of the box
- ✅ **Resource generous**: Handles video generation workloads
- ✅ **Simple deployment**: Git-based with CLI
- ✅ **Environment handling**: Easy secret management
- ✅ **Persistent storage**: Files don't disappear between requests

### Setup Commands:
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy
railway login
railway link  # Connect to your GitHub repo
railway up    # Deploy
```

### Cost: 
- **Free**: 500 hours/month, $5 credit
- **Pro**: $5/month for unlimited hours
- **Perfect for**: Development and moderate traffic

## 🥈 **Option 2: Render**

### Why Render is Good:
- ✅ **Free tier**: 750 hours/month
- ✅ **Docker support**: Full container deployment
- ✅ **Auto-deploys**: GitHub integration
- ✅ **Scaling**: Auto-scaling available

### Setup Process:
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect GitHub account
3. Create "Web Service" from your repo
4. Select "Docker" environment
5. Set environment variables in dashboard

### render.yaml (optional):
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: byte-learn
    env: docker
    dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
    envVars:
      - key: GEMINI_API_KEY
        sync: false
      - key: SUPABASE_URL
        sync: false
```

## 🥉 **Option 3: Fly.io**

### Why Fly.io Works:
- ✅ **Docker-first**: Built for containerized apps
- ✅ **Global deployment**: Edge locations worldwide
- ✅ **Persistent volumes**: For file storage
- ✅ **Performance**: Fast cold starts

### Setup Commands:
```bash
# Install flyctl
# Windows: iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
# Mac: brew install flyctl

# Setup and deploy
fly auth login
fly launch  # Creates fly.toml
fly deploy
```

### fly.toml:
```toml
app = "byte-learn"
primary_region = "sjc"

[build]

[http_service]
  internal_port = 3000
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true

[[vm]]
  memory = "1gb"
  cpu_kind = "shared"
  cpus = 1
```

## ❌ **Why Vercel/Netlify Won't Work**

### Vercel Limitations:
```
❌ No Python runtime (only Node.js/Edge)
❌ No FFmpeg support
❌ No LaTeX/TeX installation
❌ Serverless functions only (no persistent processes)
❌ 50MB deployment size limit
❌ No file system writes
❌ 10-second function timeout (video generation takes longer)
```

### Your app needs:
```
✅ Python runtime for Manim
✅ FFmpeg for video processing  
✅ LaTeX for math rendering
✅ File system for temporary video files
✅ Long-running processes (video generation)
✅ Container environment with system packages
```

## 🎯 **Deployment Decision Matrix**

### Choose Railway if:
- ✅ You want the simplest setup
- ✅ You're comfortable with moderate resource limits
- ✅ You prefer generous free tier

- ✅ You need more advanced monitoring

### Choose Fly.io if:
- ✅ You need global edge deployment
- ✅ You want the fastest performance
- ✅ You're comfortable with command-line tools
- ✅ You need more granular resource control
